This is a prototype of an idea I have.

I'm using it to learn Pixi (and to get those sweet sweet contribution greens ðŸ¤¤ ðŸ˜‰ ðŸ˜‰).

## Disclaimer: this looks fine on my machine!

I have a (singular) 1680Ã—1050 display (and a phone that I can turn sideways ofc). So it may very well look wack for you ðŸ¤·.

Now cannibalising [someone else's boilerplate](https://github.com/miltoncandelero/helloPixiDragonbones) because I have NO CLUE what I'm doing :^)
